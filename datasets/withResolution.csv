A Microbiological Survey and Characterization,"In our study, two dairy compost heaps and one vegetable scrap compost heap were constructed on two research farms in Clemson, SC. Samples were taken fr om ach heap from different locations at 8 elected intervals and analyzed for enterococ ci and VRE counts by spread plating on Bile Esculin agar (BEA) and BEA containing 6 μg/ml of vancomycin, respectively. The initial populations of enterococci and VRE in compost were in the range of 6.46-7.43 and 5.36-6.70 log CFU/g, respectively. After 30 days of active composting the average VRE populations declined ca. 4.6, 4.07, 3.97 and 1.6 logs at the top, center, bottom and surface locations of the heaps, respectively, whereas the enterococci populations declined for 4.36, 3.54, 3.10, and 2.28 logs, respectively. During the two dairy compost trials, the temperatures at the top, center, and bottom locations were in excess of 55°C for 14 – 18, 12, and 8 days, respectively, whereas temperatures of the surface samples never exceeded 32°C. During thermophilic composting, microbial activity slightly reduced the pH, there after it began to rise slightly due t o the production of ammonia.

We describe geometric non-commutative formal groups in terms of a geometric commutative formal group with a Poisson structure on its splay algebra. We describe certain natural properties of such Poisson structures and show that any such Poisson structure gives rise to a non-commutative formal group. In characterizing non-commutative formal groups G, it is natural to consider their distribution algebras, Dist(G). Although we are interested mainly in the characteristic p > 0 setting, we make an effort to work by analogy to the characteristic zero version of our problem. Let G be a formal group with Lie algebra g. We recall that, in characteristic zero, we have a canonical isomorphism between Dist(G) and the universal enveloping algebra Ug. Then our problem reduces to describing the algebraic relationship between the symmetric Sg, Ug, and the tensor algebra Tg as in the following diagram: Tg Sg ∼ − PBW Ug. (1) Here, the diagonal arrows are algebra maps and the horizontal arrow is a vector space isomorphism given by the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt (PBW) theorem. In the positive characteristic setting, there are a few features that present difficulties which are absent in the zero characteristic setting. In a sense made precise below, the problem is non-linear and, unlike in the zero characteristic setting, the algebras of importance are not quadratic. Let us recall that in characteristic zero, the PBW theorem gives an identification between Sg and the associated graded algebra of Ug.

An Alternating Mesh Quality Metric Scheme for Efficient Mesh Quality Improvement,"In the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), high-quality meshes are crucial for the stability, accuracy, and convergence of the associated PDE solver. Mesh quality improvement is often performed to improve the quality of meshes before use in numerical solution of the PDE. Mesh smoothing (performed via optimization) is one popular technique for improving the mesh quality; it does so by making adjustments to the vertex locations. When an inefficient mesh quality metric is used to design the optimization problem, and hence also to measure the mesh quality within the optimization procedure, convergence of the optimization method can be much slower than desired. However, for many applications, the choice of mesh quality metric and the optimization problem should be considered fixed. In this paper, we propose a simple mesh quality metric alternation scheme for use in the mesh optimization process. The idea is to alternate the use of the original inefficient mesh quality metric with a more efficient mesh quality metric on alternate iterations of the mesh optimization procedure in order to reduce the time to convergence, while solving the original mesh quality improvement problem. Typical results of using our application scheme to solve mesh quality improvement problems yield approximately 40-55% improvement in comparison to the original mesh optimization procedure. More frequent use of the efficient metric results in greater speed-ups.",inefficient mesh quality metric with a more efficient mesh quality metric,"[0.5454545454545454, 0.5454545454545454, 0.5454545454545454]"

Implementing interference cancellation to increase the EV-DO Rev A reverse link capacity,"This article provides the principles and practice of how interference cancellation can be implemented on the EV-DO Rev A reverse link. It is shown that applying interference cancellation to CDMA achieves the multiple access channel sum rate capacity for either frame synchronous or asynchronous users. The per user SINR gain from space-time interference cancellation translates directly into a CDMA capacity gain of the same factor, allowing EV-DO Rev A to support more users with higher data rates. We demonstrate how interference cancellation can be added to base station processing without modifying user terminals, EV-DO standards, or network coverage. We present commercially viable receiver architectures for implementing interference cancellation with the asynchronism and H-ARQ of EV-DO RevA, and explain why closed loop power control can operate the same way it does today. Network level simulations over a wide range of channels confirm that interference cancellation offers significant capacity gains for all users, while maintaining the same link budget and system stability.",interference cancellation translates directly into a CDMA capacity gain of the same,"[0.4166666666666667, 0.38461538461538464, 0.4]"
Smart detectors for Monte Carlo radiative transfer Maarten Baes,"Many optimization techniques have been invented to reduce the noise that is inherent in Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. As the typical detectors used in Monte Carlo simulations do not take into account all the information contained in the impacting photon packages, there is still room to optimize this detection process and the corresponding estimate of the surface brightness distributions. We want to investigate how all the information contained in the distribution of impacting photon packages can be optimally used to decrease the noise in the surface brightness distributions and hence to increase the efficiency of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. We demonstrate that the estimate of the surface brightness distribution in a Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulation is similar to the estimate of the density distribution in an SPH simulation. Based on this similarity, a recipe is constructed for smart detectors that take full advantage of the exact location of the impact of the photon packages. Several types of smart detectors, each corresponding to a different smoothing kernel, are presented. We show that smart detectors, while preserving the same effective resolution, reduce the noise in the surface brightness distributions compared to the classical detectors. The most efficient smart detector realizes a noise reduction of about 10%, which corresponds to a reduction of the required number of photon packages (i.e. a reduction of the simulation run time) of 20%. As the practical implementation of the smart detectors is straightforward and the additional computational cost is completely negligible, we recommend the use of smart detectors in Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.",the use of smart detectors in Monte Carlo radiative,"[0.5555555555555556, 0.5555555555555556, 0.5555555555555556]"

Low Overhead Soft Error Mitigation Techniques for High-Performance and Aggressive Designs,"The threat of soft error induced system failure in computing systems has become more prominent, as we adopt ultradeep submicron process technologies. In this paper, we propose two efficient soft error mitigation schemes, namely, Soft Error Mitigation (SEM) and Soft and Timing Error Mitigation (STEM), using the approach of multiple clocking of data for protecting combinational logic blocks from soft errors. Our first technique, SEM, based on distributed and temporal voting of three registers, unloads the soft error detection overhead from the critical path of the systems. SEM is also capable of ignoring false errors and recovers from soft errors using in-situ fast recovery avoiding recomputation. Our second technique, STEM, while tolerating soft errors, adds timing error detection capability to guarantee reliable execution in aggressively clocked designs that enhance system performance by operating beyond worst-case clock frequency. We also present a specialized low overhead clock phase management scheme that ably supports our proposed techniques. Timing-annotated gate-level simulations, using 45 nm libraries, of a pipelined adder-multiplier and DLX processor show that both our techniques achieve near 100 percent fault coverage. For DLX processor, even under severe fault injection campaigns, SEM achieves an average performance improvement of 26.58 percent over a conventional triple modular redundancy voter-based soft error mitigation scheme, while STEM outperforms SEM by 27.42 percent.","soft error mitigation schemes, namely, Soft Error Mitigation (SEM) and Soft","[0.36363636363636365, 0.3333333333333333, 0.34782608695652173]"

A Batch Arrival Queue System with Coxian-2 Server Vacations and Admissibility Restricted,"The M/G/1 classic queueing system were extended by many authors in last two decades. The systems with server’s vacation are important models that extend the M/G/1 queueing system. Also another conditions such as admissibility restricted may occure in systems. From this motivation, in this system I consider a single server queue with batch arrival Poisson input. There is a restricted admissibility of arriving batches in which not all batches are allowed to join the system at all times. At each service completion epoch, the server may apt to take a vacation with probability θ or else with probability 1 − θ may continue to be available in the system for the next service. The vacation period of the server has two heterogenous phases. Phase one is compulsory, and phase two follows the phase one vacation in such a way that the server may take phase two with probability p or may return back to the system with probability 1 − p. The vacation times are assumed to be general. All stochastic processes involved in this system (service and vacation times) are independent of each other.

The Metal-Dielectric Transition in Semimetals in Extremely High Magnetic Fields .,"An analysis is given of a model of a semimetal with isotropic electron and hole spectra, separated in momentum space. The applied magnetic field is assumed to be strong enough to ensure that only one quantum level participates in each spectrum. The overlapping of levels is such that the Fermi energy is greater than the binding energy of the particle pairs. Weak point interaction is assumed to operate between the particles, which is valid for fields and dielectric constants that are not too high. The sign of the interaction can be arbitrary. Since the analysis is concerned with spinless fermions (degeneracy removed by the field), the system exhibits interactions between electrons and holes, but there is no interaction between particles of the same kind. It is shown that Cooper pairing of particles with the same charge is absent, but electron-hole excitons are formed, i.e., the transition to a dielectric takes place. The problem leads to ""parquet"" equations and is therefore solved only with logarithmic accuracy.

Controlling the transport of an ion: classical and quantum mechanical solutions,"The accurate transport of an ion over macroscopic distances represents a challenging control problem due to the different length and time scales that enter and the experimental limitations on the controls that need to be accounted for. Here, we investigate the performance of different control techniques for ion transport in state-of-the-art segmented miniaturized ion traps. We employ numerical optimization of classical trajectories and quantum wavepacket propagation as well as analytical solutions derived from invariant based inverse engineering and geometric optimal control. The applicability of each of the control methods depends on the length and time scales of the transport. Our comprehensive set of tools allows us make a number of observations. We find that accurate shuttling can be performed with operation times below the trap oscillation period. The maximum speed is limited by the maximum acceleration that can be exerted on the ion. When using controls obtained from classical dynamics for wavepacket propagation, wavepacket squeezing is the only quantum effect that comes into play for a large range of trapping parameters. We show that this can be corrected by a compensating force derived from invariant based inverse engineering, without a significant increase in the operation time.

Context-aware web search using dynamically weighted information fusion,"Web search has become a cornerstone tool for Internet users. The information one is able to retrieve quickly with commercial tools is awe inspiring, yet average users still remain frustrated with finding information that is truly relevant to them.

We do this by exploring context data, using query enhancement techniques, and appropriately fusing the results to provide the best ordering when presenting the results to the user. Context data includes a user’s personal calendar, location, preferences, personal vocabulary, and peer recommendations. Query enhancement involves utilizing relevant contextual information to decorate a user’s query text to produce a more focused query. Information fusion allows the query results to be compared and re-ordered using contextual data by utilizing either a sum of products, a Bayesian technique, or a combination of the two.

Optimizing Features in Active Machine Learning for Complex Qualitative Content Analysis,"We propose a semi-automatic approach for content analysis that leverages machine learning (ML) being initially trained on a small set of hand-coded data to perform a first pass in coding, and then have human annotators correct machine annotations in order to produce more examples to retrain the existing model incrementally for better performance. In this “active learning” approach, it is equally important to optimize the creation of the initial ML model given less training data so that the model is able to capture most if not all positive examples, and filter out as many negative examples as possible for human annotators to correct. This paper reports our attempt to optimize the initial ML model through feature exploration in a complex content analysis project that uses a multidimensional coding scheme, and contains codes with sparse positive examples.

Stability of Some Generalized Godunov Schemes With Linear High-Order Reconstructions,"Classical Semi-Lagrangian schemes have the advantage of allowing large time steps, but fail in general to be conservative. Trying to keep the advantages of both large time steps and conservative structure, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian schemes have been proposed for various problems, in a form which represent (at least in a single space dimension) a high-order, large time-step generalization of the Godunov scheme. At the theoretical level, a recent result has shown the equivalence of the two versions of Semi-Lagrangian schemes for constant coefficient advection equations, while, on the other hand, classical Semi-Lagrangian schemes have been proved to be strictly related to area-weighted Lagrange–Galerkin schemes for both constant and variable coefficient equations. We address in this paper a further issue in this theoretical framework, i.e., the relationship between stability of classical and of FluxForm Semi-Lagrangian schemes.

Upcycling strategies for waste electronic and electrical equipment based on material flow analysis,"Upcycling generally refers to the conversion of waste materials to something useful or valuable and is a useful concept that can be applied not only to the waste design industry but also to waste recycling and resource circulation. Our study highlights upcycling as the key concept for improving the value of waste by redefining the concept as “the recycling of waste materials and discarded products in ways that enhance their value.” Four upcycling strategies are linked to material flow analyses conducted on waste electronic and electrical equipment, specifically waste refrigerators and waste computers, to examine the technologies available for implementation and suggest guidelines for the promotion of upcycling. The amount of waste refrigerators collected by the formal sector was 121,642 tons/y and the informal sector, 63,823 tons/y. The current recycling ratio of waste refrigerators was estimated as 88.53%. A total of 7,585 tons/y of waste computers were collected by the formal sector and 3,807 tons/y by the informal sector after discharge. Meanwhile, the current recycling ratio of waste computers was estimated as 77.43%.

Melia: A MapReduce Framework on OpenCL-Based FPGAs,"MapReduce, originally developed by Google for search applications, has recently become a popular programming framework for parallel and distributed environments. This paper presents an energy-efficient architecture design for MapReduce on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The major goal is to enable users to program FPGAs with simple MapReduce interfaces, and meanwhile to embrace automatic performance optimizations within the MapReduce framework. Compared to other processors like CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are (re-)programmable hardware and have very low energy consumption. However, the design and implementation of MapReduce on FPGAs can be challenging: firstly, FPGAs are usually programmed with hardware description languages, which hurts the programmability of the MapReduce design to its users; secondly, since MapReduce has irregular access patterns (especially in the reduce phase) and needs to support user-defined functions, careful designs and optimizations are required for efficiency. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate Melia, a MapReduce framework on FPGAs. Melia takes advantage of the recent OpenCL programming framework developed for Altera FPGAs, and abstracts FPGAs behind the simple and familiar MapReduce interfaces in C. We further develop a series of FPGA-centric optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of Melia, and a costand resource-based approach to automate the parameter settings for those optimizations. We evaluate Melia on a recent Altera Stratix V GX FPGA with a number of commonly used MapReduce benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that 1) the efficiency and effectiveness of our optimizations and automated parameter setting approach, 2) Melia can achieve promising energy efficiency in comparison with its counterparts on CPUs/GPUs on both single-FPGA and cluster settings.",MapReduce framework on FPGAs takes advantage of,"[0.5714285714285714, 0.5, 0.5333333333333333]"
High statistics calculations of quenched QCD spectrum using various quark sources,"We present the results for the hadron spectrum calculated on 400 configurations using point source, wall source and 8-cubic sources, in quenched QCD with Wilson fermions at β = 6.0 and K = 0.155 on a 24 3 × 54 lattice. The results for the ground state masses obtained with three types of quark sources agree well with each other. Masses of the first excited states appear consistent with experimental values within large errors. Recent high statistics simulations of quenched QCD have produced high quality data for the masses of light hadrons[1–5]. However, mass results obtained with various types of quark sources often do not agree with each other[6,1,2]. Masses of the first excited states also often appear unexpectedly heavy[2,3,7]. In order to resolve these problems, the QCD-PAX Collaboration has carried out a high statistics quenched calculation with Wilson quarks at β= 6.0 on a 24 3 × 54 lattice. Taking the last configuration of our previous work[1] as a starting configuration, we have generated new 400 configurations which are separated by 1000 heat bath sweeps. We choose K = 0.155: This K corresponds approximately to the strange quark mass, because the m π /m ρ appears to be 0.7. We use three types of quark sources: point source, wall source and 8-origin cubic sources of a size 7 3 (with a random Z(3) element on each cube). We call the third source multi-cube source. Hereafter we abbreviate them to p-, wand m-sources, respectively. Point sinks are used for all sources. Configurations are fixed to Coulomb gauge before quark propagators are solved for the wand the m-sources.

Inter-Tier Interference Suppression in Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks,"Incorporating cloud computing into heterogeneous networks, the heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) has been proposed as a promising paradigm to enhance both spectral and energy efficiencies. Developing interference suppression strategies is critical for suppressing the inter-tier interference between remote radio heads (RRHs) and a macro base station (MBS) in H-CRANs. In this paper, inter-tier interference suppression techniques are considered in the contexts of collaborative processing and cooperative radio resource allocation (CRRA). In particular, interference collaboration (IC) and beamforming (BF) are proposed to suppress the inter-tier interference, and their corresponding performance is evaluated. Closed-form expressions for the overall outage probabilities, system capacities, and average bit error rates under these two schemes are derived. Furthermore, IC- and BF-based CRRA optimization models are presented to maximize the RRH-accessed users' sum rates via power allocation, which is solved with convex optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived expressions for these performance metrics for IC and BF are accurate, and the relative performance between IC and BF schemes depends on system parameters such as the number of antennas at the MBS, the number of RRHs, and the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio threshold. Furthermore, it is seen that the sum rates of IC and BF schemes increase almost linearly with the transmit power threshold under the proposed CRRA optimization solution.",and the relative performance between IC and BF schemes,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
Identification of Flexible Space Structure Models Using Operating Data,"IDENTIFICATION OF FLEXIBLE SPACE STRUCTURE MODELS USING OPERATING DATA Albert Bosse, Doctoral Research Assistant Gary Slater, Professor Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics University of Cincinnati Cincinnati, OH 45221.0070 USA A procedure called Reference Model Adaptation (RMA) is presented whose primary objective is the estimation of impulse response functions of a multivariable flexible structure under closed loop control. The RMA scheme, which operates on input and output time histories, is envisioned to track slowly time-varying system characteristics which m&y be present in flexible spacecraft systems due to anomalies, maintenance, or evolving substructures. Primary considerations are the minimization of disturbances required by the identification process in extracting system models from the operating data, and the provision of updated models for the redesign or reconfiguration of active vibration controllers. Early development efforts have focused on the problem of closed loop identification of system impulse response functions, results from which are given in this paper.

We begin with a brief discussion of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves that are likely to be detected first by the coming in operation laser interferometers, such as GEO, LIGO, VIRGO. Then, we proceed to relic gravitational waves emphasizing their quantum-mechanical origin and the inevitability of their existence. Combining the theory with available observations, we discuss the prospects of direct detection of relic gravitational waves. A considerable part of the paper is devoted to comparison of relic gravitational waves with the density perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin. It is shown how the phenomenon of squeezing of quantum-mechanically generated cosmological perturbations manifests itself in the periodic structures of the metric power spectra and in the oscillatory behaviour of the CMBR multipoles Cl as a function of l. The cosmological importance of the theoretically calculated (statistical) dipole moment C1 is stressed. The paper contains also some comments on the damage to gravitational-wave research inflicted by the “standard inflationary result”.

Towards time-parallel road traffic simulation,"As an alternative to spatial parallelization of simulation models, time-parallel simulation offers the potential for massive parallelism with a high level of independence between the parallel processes. Unfortunately, due to inherent problems, the applicability of time-parallel simulation is restricted. Therefore, it has been proposed recently, to use approximation with time-parallel simulation in order to facilitate its application and to extend the class of models suitable for time-parallel simulation. As a proof-of-concept, this work shows how approximate temporal parallelization can be applied to the simulation of road traffic. Traffic simulation is used extensively in transportation research for various purposes, e.g. analysis of traffic phenomena,traffic forecast, and optimization of traffic flow. Depending on the level of fidelity, a traffic model exhibits a state space of moderate to high complexity.

Wage and Productivity Dispersion : Labor Quality or Rent Sharing ? ∗,"Wage and labor productivity differ across firms, and more productive firms tend to pay higher wages. We consider a model that allows for differences in capital, employment and labor quality as well as rent sharing, all of which should help explain these observations. We estimate the model using detailed matched employer-employee data from the manufacturing sector in Denmark. The production function estimation is embedded in a structural equation system involving worker, firm, time, and occupation effects from an individual wage decomposition and accounting for labor input components that are substitutes and complements, while accommodating stochastically varying factor productivity. We find that both input heterogeneity and intrinsic differences in total factor productivity across firms are important explanations. In the case of Manufacturing, about 41% of the dispersion in log value added per worker is attributable to cross-firm differences in the levels of capital per worker, while another 39% of the variation stems from intrinsic TFP differences. Only 5% is associated with quality differences in the labor input. In the case of individual log wages, 70% of the variation is due to individual characteristics, whereas only 13% is attributable to firm differences. Our results suggest that there are major gains to reallocation of labor from less to more productive firms. Rent sharing enhances the reallocation process by inducing wage dispersion that motivates worker search. The relatively small contribution of firm heterogeneity to individual wage dispersion is thus consistent with the inefficient allocation of labor across firms.",input heterogeneity and intrinsic differences in total factor productivity across firms are,"[0.16666666666666666, 0.2222222222222222, 0.1904761904761905]"

Performance analysis of preemption-aware scheduling in multi-cluster grid environments,"Resource provisioning is one of the main challenges in resource sharing environments such as multi-cluster Grids. In these environments each cluster serves requests from external (grid) users along with their own local users. The problem arises when there is not sufficient resources for local users (which have higher priority than grid users) to be served urgently. This problem could be solved by preempting resources from grid users and allocating them to the local users. However, resource preemption entails crucial side-effects such as decreasing resource utilization and increasing grid users’ response time. Considering preemption side-effects, the question is that how we can minimize the number of preemptions taking place in a resource sharing environment. In this paper, we propose a preemption-aware scheduling policy for a virtualized multi-cluster Grid in a way that the number of preemptions is minimized. The proposed policy is based on the stochastic analysis of routing in parallel non-observable queues which acts independent from the availability information of each cluster. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheduling policy significantly decreases the number of virtual machine (VM) preemptions (up to 22.5%) which affects both resource utilization and average response time of grid requests.",from grid users and allocating resources to local users,"[0.1111111111111111, 0.09090909090909091, 0.09999999999999999]"
The subspace approach as a first stage in speech enhancement,"To increase the performance of the communication systems and other applications related to speech or speaker recognition, it is usual to incorporate a preprocessing stage for speech enhancement before it enters a specific system. Although the signal subspace approach is very useful, it becomes less effective when the signal to noise ratio is lower than 10 dB. This is due to possible inaccuracies in estimating the noise, whose action on the different phonemes and frequency bands is far from uniform, even considering white noise. A critical point is estimating the signal subspace dimension. It not only depends on the variance the noise level but also on SNR, too, which varies according to the different temporal segments of speech as well as the frequency band. Then it is proposed to work on temporal frames in each critical band using as the reference the noise variance affected by a factor which depends on the particular SNR segment being considered to estimate the signal dimension Thus weak signal components are preserved which could be eliminated otherwise. The noisy signal projection on the signal subspace can be regarded as a first stage in the speech enhancement process that has to be complement with additional techniques.","the signal subspace approach is very useful, the signal subspace","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]"

Release Behaviour of Cryptomeria Japonica Pollen Allergenic Cry J 1 and Cry J 2 in Rainwater Containing Air Pollutants,"Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) pollinosis is the most popular pollinosis in Japan. In recent years, it was reported that the most Cryptomeria japonica pollen allergenic species were scattered as fi ne particles in the urban atmosphere. It is thought that allergenic fi ne particles are responsible for inducing asthma by breaking into lower respiratory tract; this phenomenon was observed in fi eld investigations during sunny days after rainfall. Hence, it is considered that the release of fi ne allergenic species derived from pollen grains may be induced during rainfall events. For this reason, we investigated the releasing behaviour of Cryptomeria japonica pollen allergenic species in rainwater containing air pollutants, through rainwater sampling and laboratory experiments. The pollen grain counts, pollen burst ratios, ionic concentrations and pH in each rainwater sample were measured, when rainwater samples were separately collected in Saitama City, a suburban area north of Tokyo metropolis. Additionally, three simulated rainwater (SR) samples were prepared to investigate the releasing behaviour of pollen allergenic species. In the samplings, the most pollen grains were trapped into initial rainwater (IR). Moreover, burst pollen grains were observed in many rainwater samples. Burst ratio of pollen grains were positively correlated with pH and ionic concentrations in rainwater. Therefore, it was thought that pollen grains were washed out by IR containing air pollutants. On the other hand, for the laboratory experiments, the elution of allergenic Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 was observed when pollen grains were exposed to different SR samples. A time-dependent increase of Cry j 1 was observed, but the elution of Cry j 2 was not observed from pollen grains exposed to SR samples. In particular, the elution of Cry j 1 increased by contact with SR samples under conditions of Asian dust events.

Systematic characterization of small inductively coupled radiofrequency coils as MR-visible markers at 1 . 5 T,"Introduction: MR-guided interventions may benefit from a proper visualization or localization of the deployed instruments. MR-visible markers are usually categorized with respect to their design and method of detection: (1) active markers are signal receivers wired to the scanner, (2) passive ones have no electric components and operate via a positive (paramagnetic agent) or negative (susceptibility) contrast, and (3) semi-active or inductively coupled markers have no connection but involve conducting wires [1]. The goal of this work was to systematically characterize the small inductively coupled solenoid coils and evaluate their suitability as MR-visible markers for interventional applications at 1.5T.  Methods and Materials: The small markers (Fig. 1) consisted of a solenoid coil (inductance 0.06 μH) with four turns of an insulated copper wire around a water-filled glass tube (inner/outer Ø=2.2/4.0 mm). An MR-compatible capacitor (ATC, NY) was used to tune the circuit to the resonance frequency (≈63.7 MHz) of a 1.5T MRI (Siemens, Germany). The quality factor of the loaded circuit was determined to be ≈110. All measurements were made with the integrated body coil using a plastic bottle filled with NiSO4 solution as background phantom. Marker imaging was performed with a balanced SSFP sequence (TrueFISP, matrix size=512, FOV/slice thickness=300 mm, TR/TE=6.8/2.8 ms, bandwidth=220 Hz/pixel) in the three standard projections using flip angles (FA) in the 0.1°–90.0° range. The contrastto-noise ratio was calculated as CNR=(SM–SB)/SB, with SM as maximum marker and SB as background signal averaged over a fixed ROI. Fig. 1: Resonant RF coil as MR marker. The spatial dependence of the TrueFISP marker signals (FA=0.3°) was investigated by translating the markers along the x and z axes in the ±240 mm range around the isocenter. The marker was also placed on a custom-made rotary mount (positioned horizontally) to measure the angular dependence of the TrueFISP marker signal (FA=0.3°) as a function of tilt angle θTRA (between solenoid axis and transverse plane). An existing localization algorithm was used at this stage to evaluate the suitability for an automatic detection algorithm [2]. Inductive heating of the marker coils during RF exposition was measured to assess potential safety hazards. The temperatures were monitored with a 4-channel fiber optical thermometer (Fluoroptic 700, Luxtron, CA) with one probe taped on the coil wire and another placed inside the glass tube near the geometrical center of the solenoid. Four different sequences were investigated over a time span of 21 min (1 min baseline, 10 min exposition, 10 min cool down): HASTE (TR/TE=1090/121 ms, FA=150°, SAR=1.93 W/kg), VIBE (TR/TE=3.8/1.4 ms, FA=15°, SAR=0.49 W/kg), TrueFISP with a standard (TR/TE=4.3/2.2 ms, FA=72°, SAR=1.95 W/kg) and with a low flip angle (TR/TE=9.7/4.2 ms, FA=2°, SAR<0.001 W/kg). Measurements were performed at an ambient temperature of ≈24°C with the MRI ventilator switched off. Results: The markers typically imposed as round (Ø=2.2±0.1 mm, n=10) or oval (2.0±0.1 mm × 3.1±0.4 mm wide) clearly visible, hyperintense objects (Fig. 2). The highest CNR (≈130) on a coronal image was obtained at a flip angle of 0.3° (Fig. 3). During translation along the x and z axes, all marker CNRs were larger than 16 while values around the isocenter were much larger (Fig. 4). For tilt angles θTRA from 0° to 55° all markers were successfully detected in all views with CNR values above 7.5 (Fig. 5). Under RF exposition, heating inside the tube was slightly larger than directly on the outside of the copper wire. The maximum temperature increase ΔTmax was ≈5.0°C after HASTE and standard TrueFISP exposition and ≈1.3°C applying a VIBE sequence.

"A Prognostic and Warning System for Power Electronic Modules in Electric, Hybrid, and Fuel Cell Vehicles","Reliability of power electronics modules is of paramount importance for the commercial success of various types of electric vehicles. In this paper, we study the technical feasibility of detecting early symptoms and warning signs of power module degradation due to thermomechanical stress and fatigue, and developing a prognostic system that monitors the state of health of the power modules in electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. A signature degradation trace of the on-voltage of IGBT modules was observed from accelerated power cycling test. This on-voltage ""anomaly"" can be attributed to sequential events of solder joint degradation followed by wirebond lift-off mechanisms. A quasi real-time IGBT failure prognostic algorithm based on monitoring the abnormal VCEsat variation at specific currents and temperatures is developed. The algorithm was verified using extensive SIMULINK modeling.

AR-Weapon: Live Augmented Reality Based First-Person Shooting System,"This paper introduces a user-worn Augmented Reality (AR) based first-person weapon shooting system (AR-Weapon), suitable for both training and gaming. Different from existing AR-based first-person shooting systems, AR-Weapon does not use fiducial markers placed in the scene for tracking. Instead it uses natural scene features observed by the tracking camera from the live view of the world. The AR-Weapon system estimates 6-degrees of freedom orientation and location of the weapon and of the user operating it, thus allowing the weapon to fire simulated projectiles for both direct fire and non-line of sight during live runs. In addition, stereo cameras are used to compute depth and provide dynamic occlusion reasoning. Using the 6-DOF head and weapon tracking, dynamic occlusion reasoning and a terrain model of the environment, the fully virtual projectiles and synthetic avatars are displayed on the user's head mounted Optical-See-Through (OST) display overlaid over the live view of the real world. Since the projectiles, weapon characteristics and virtual enemy combatants are all simulated they can easily be changed to vary scenarios, new projectile types and future weapons.

Image indexing using a colored pattern appearance model,"We introduce a new method for colour image indexing and content-based image retrieval. An image is divided into small sub-images and the visual appearance of which is characterised by a coloured pattern appearance model. The statistics of the local visual appearance of the image are then computed as measures of the global visual appearance of the image. The visual appearance of the small sub-images is modelled by their spatial pattern, colour direction and local energy strength. To encode the local visual appearance, an approach based on vector quantisation (VQ) is introduced. The distributions of the VQ code indices are then used to index/retrieve the images. The new method can not only be used to achieve effective image indexing and retrieval; it can also be used for image compression. Based on this method, indexing and retrieval can be easily and conveniently performed in the compressed domain without performing decoding operation.",of the local visual appearance of An image,"[0.25, 0.25, 0.25]"

The method of effective electron algorithm with combination of Monte-Carlo method is used to perform the simulation and predict multipactor breakdown thresholds. The breakdown thresholds of the proposed structure are presented for different values of frequency-gap product. The results indicate that increasing the radius of filter increases the RF breakdown threshold.

On Fréchet Differentiability of Lipschitzian Functions on Spaces with Gaussian Measures,"We construct two counter-examples related to Fréchet differentiability in infinite dimensions. The first one gives a convex Lipschitzian function on a Banach space such that its convolution with a given measure is Fréchet differentiable only on a measure zero set. The second one gives a Borel function on a space with a Gaussian measure such that it is Lipschitzian along the Cameron–Martin subspace, but is Fréchet differentiable along this subspace only on a measure zero set. This answers a long standing open question. AMS Subject Classification: 28C20, 49J50 The problem of Fréchet differentiability of Lipschitzian functions has attracted a considerable attention in the last decades. One of the major achievements in this area is Preiss’s theorem [1] according to which every Lipschitzian function on a Hilbert space is Fréchet differentiable on a dense set. However, this set may be small in many respects, in particular, it may have measure zero with respect to every nondegenerate Gaussian measure. The consideration of Gaussian measures on infinite dimensional spaces in relation with Fréchet differentiability brings new problems that are specifically infinite dimensional. Every Radon Gaussian measure γ on a space X (which is a Banach space or, more generally, a locally convex space) possesses the so called Cameron–Martin space H (called also the reproducing kernel), which is a separable Hilbert space with some norm | · |H and is compactly embedded into X. If X is infinite dimensional, then H is much smaller than X, although it may be dense in X. For many reasons, it is natural to consider functions on X that are Fréchet differentiable along H. A function f on X is called Fréchet differentiable along H (or Fréchet H-differentiable) at a point x ∈ X if there is a vector DHf(x) ∈ H such that f(x + h)− f(x)− (DHf(x), h)H = o(h), h ∈ H, where lim |h|→0 |h|−1 H |o(h)|H = 0. It turns out that this weaker property is much more flexible and that many natural functions are Fréchet differentiable along H not even being continuous on X. For example, the convolution",every Lipschitzian function on a Hilbert space is Fréchet differentiable on,"[0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666]"
Experimental determination of Representative Volume Element ( RVE ) size in woven composites,"A systematic approach is proposed to estimate the length scales of the representative volume element (RVE) in orthogonal plain woven composites. The approach is based on experimental full-field deformation measurements at mesoscopic scales. Stereovision digital image correlation (DIC) is conducted to determine the full-field strain distribution in onand off-axis specimens loaded axially in tension. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to optimize the image correlation parameters. Using the optimized set of image correlation parameters, full-field strains are measured and used in conjunction with a simple strain averaging algorithm to identify the length scales at which globally applied and spatially-averaged local strains converge in values. The size of a virtual window containing local strain data, the average of which has the same value as the global strain, is identified as the RVE dimensions for the examined material. The smallest RVE sizes found in this work are shown to be both strain and angle dependent. The largest RVE dimension obtained is reported as a unique, strain and orientation insensitive RVE size for the woven composite examined.","as the global strain, is identified as the RVE dimensions for the examined","[0.07692307692307693, 0.09090909090909091, 0.08333333333333334]"
POTSHARDS : Secure Long-Term Archival Storage Without Encryption Technical Report UCSC-SSRC-0603,"Modern archival storage systems either store data in the clear, ignoring security, or rely on keyed encryption to ensure privacy. However, the use of encryption is a major concern when data must be stored an indefinite period of time—key management becomes increasingly difficult as file lifetimes increase, and data loss becomes increasingly likely because keys are a single point of failure and losing a key is comparable to data deletion. Moreover, traditional systems are subject to the obsolescence of encryption algorithms themselves, which can expose petabytes of data the instant a cryptographic algorithm is broken. To address these concerns, we developed POTSHARDS, an archival storage system that addresses the long-term security needs of data with very long lifetimes without the use of encryption. POTSHARDS separates security and redundancy by utilizing two levels of secret splitting in a way that allows the original data to be reconstructed from the stored pieces. However, the data structures used in POTSHARDS are also designed in such a way that an unauthorized user attempting to collect sufficient shares to reconstruct any data will not go unnoticed because it is very difficult to launch a targeted attack on the system, even with unrestricted access to a few archives. Since POTSHARDS provides secure storage for arbitrarily long periods of time, its data structures inclu de built-in support for consistency checking and data migration. An evaluation of our POTSHARDS implementation shows that it stores and retrieves data at 2.5–5MB/s, demonstrates its ability to recover user data given all of the pieces a user has stored across the archives, and shows its ability to recover from the loss of an entire archive.",POTSHARDS implementation's ability to recover user data given all of the,"[0.08333333333333333, 0.07692307692307693, 0.08]"

Relative Camera Pose Estimation Method Using Optimization on the Manifold,"To solve the problem of relative camera pose estimation, a method using optimization with respect to the manifold is proposed. Firstly from maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) model to nonlinear least squares (NLS) model, the general state estimation model using optimization is derived. Then the camera pose estimation model is applied to the general state estimation model, while the parameterization of rigid body transformation is represented by Lie group/algebra. The jacobian of point-pose model with respect to Lie group/algebra is derived in detail and thus the optimization model of rigid body transformation is established. Experimental results show that compared with the original algorithms, the approaches with optimization can obtain higher accuracy both in rotation and translation, while avoiding the singularity of Euler angle parameterization of rotation. Thus the proposed method can estimate relative camera pose with high accuracy and robustness. * Corresponding author",the camera pose estimation model is applied to the general,"[0.4, 0.4, 0.4000000000000001]"

The anomalous effects in the three-electrode system for dielectric loss measurements,"The physical parameters of the guard gap between the guard and the guarded electrodes of the three electrode system generally used for dielectric loss measurements can be modelled by a simple T-network. Theoretical analysis shows that under certain conditions these parameters can cause great errors or even make the apparent dissipation factor negative, when measured with a Schering bridge. The sharp edges of the guard and the guarded electrodes may result in the creation of high local fields and give rise to electric discharges under high voltage conditions. Local discharges near the sharp edges directly modify the physical parameters of the guard gap. Such anomalous phenomena have been experimentally observed and they can be attributed to the change in physical parameters in the guard gap.

Java security: present and near future,"2 there has been strong and growing interest in Java's security as well as in new security issues raised by this technology's deployment. These concerns have reached the mainstream—the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and others have run stories on Java security. However, we must examine Java's trustworthiness comprehensively, from a broad dependability perspective, 3-6 not simply from the journalistic view. A simplistic statement such as "" Java is [or is not] secure "" doesn't come close to capturing the complexity of the issues involved. To pass judgment on whether Java is a trustworthy language or platform, we must precisely specify requirements of the overall system— in this case, computer systems and the global Internet infrastructure. Only then can we hope to demonstrate vigorously that the platform architecture satisfies or contributes to the satisfaction of the overall requirements, and that the platform's actual implementation satisfies the architecture's design requirement. Unfortunately, neither of these two crucial steps is feasible for security today. The shape and the characteristics of the national (or global) system infrastructure are evolving rapidly. Consequently, such widely used terms as "" Internet security "" cannot capture the essence of the trustworthiness required of such an infrastructure. (Admittedly, such terms were not very helpful in the past, either.) Moreover, though formal methods have been used successfully to verify some hardware devices, they are not sufficiently advanced to address correctness issues of large-scale software systems. Given this state of affairs, we must use an alternative (albeit less scientific and idealistic) set of criteria to examine platform trust-worthiness. From an industrial point of view, such criteria must include the following considerations: • Usability—To be ubiquitous and accepted in the marketplace, the platform must be easy to use for building small-and large-scale systems and applications. • Simplicity—To inspire confidence in its correctness, the platform cannot be too complex to analyze (by code inspection or testing, for example) for critical properties. • Adequacy—The platform must contain all essential features and building blocks for supporting higher-level trust-worthiness (security) requirements. • Adaptability—The platform must evolve with ease, following demand and market reality. Judged by these (perhaps biased) criteria, Java scores very favorably compared with other existing languages and programming systems. In particular, Java's platform independence greatly reduces the complexity— and thus the probability of design and implementation errors—of dealing with heterogeneous environments. The "" write once, run everywhere "" philosophy also helps improve …",the platform architecture satisfies or contributes,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Blending of Two and Three-way Interactions for Modeling Multi-relational Data,"Much work has been recently proposed to model relational data, especially in the multi-relational case, where di↵erent kinds of relationships are used to connect the various data entities. Previous attempts either consist of powerful systems with high capacity to model complex connectivity patterns, which unfortunately usually end up overfitting on rare relationships, or in approaches that trade capacity for simplicity in order to fairly model all relationships, frequent or not. In this paper, we propose a happy medium obtained by complementing a high-capacity model with a simpler one, both pre-trained separately and jointly finetuned.

From the dependence of the rate constants on temperature, the activation parameters have been calculated and also the isokinetic temperature with a value of 403.5 K. Based on this reaction, determination of eight aromatic aldehydes in a concentration range of 1.49 Ð91 μg/ml is proposed.

Variable step-size compressed sensing-based sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm for speech reconstruction,"This paper presents a novel greedy reconstruction algorithm for speech signal, named the variable step-size sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm (short for VSSAMP). As the name implies, this modified algorithm achieves an improvement compared with the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP). The new algorithm varies the step size, which is fixed in SAMP. This innovation can accelerate the reconstruction speed and demonstrate a better performance on estimating the true signal's support set to some extent. The step size is set to a large value initially so as to approach the real sparsity quickly. Afterwards, step size is cut down gradually and this mechanism is benefit for estimating the sparsity accurately. At the end of the novel method, a pruning step is utilized which can decrease the estimated sparsity one atom by one atom, based on reducing the reconstruction error. This step increases the accuracy of estimated sparsity and enhances the reconstruction performance. The comparisions of reconstruction performance and speed are exhibited in this paper. The simulation results show that the modified algorithm outperforms the SAMP algorithm when reconstructing absolutely sparse signals and speech signals.",greedy algorithm sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm sparsity,"[0.3333333333333333, 0.35714285714285715, 0.3448275862068965]"
A Hybrid Text Classification System Using Sentential Frequent Itemsets,"Text classification techniques mostly rely on single term analysis of the document data set, while more concepts especially the specific ones are usually conveyed by set of terms.

Experiments over the Reuters corpus are carried out, which validate the practicability of the proposed system.

ExoMol molecular line lists-XXVI : spectra of SH and NS,"Line lists for the sulphur-containing molecules SH (the mercapto radical) and NS are computed as part of the ExoMol project. These line lists consider transitions within the X Π ground state for SH, SH, SH and SD, and NS, NS, NS, NS and NS. Ab initio potential energy (PEC) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) curves are computed and then improved by fitting to experimentally observed transitions. Fully ab initio dipole moment curves (DMCs) computed at high level of theory are used to produce the final line lists. For SH, our fit gives a root-meansquare (rms) error of 0.03 cm between the observed (vmax = 4, Jmax = 34.5) and calculated transitions wavenumbers; this is extrapolated such that allX Π rotationalvibrational-electronic (rovibronic) bound states are considered. For SH the resulting line list contains about 81 000 transitions and 2 300 rovibronic states, considering levels up to vmax = 14 and Jmax = 60.5. For NS the refinement used a combination of experimentally determined frequencies and energy levels and led to an rms fitting error of 0.002 cm. Each NS calculated line list includes around 2.8 million transitions and 31 000 rovibronic states with a vibrational range up to v = 53 and rotational range to J = 235.5, which covers up to 23 000 cm.

The capacity of PIR is the maximum number of bits of desired information per bit of downloaded information among all PIR schemes. The capacity has recently been characterized for PIR as well as several of its variants. In every case it is assumed that all the queries are generated by the user simultaneously. Here we consider multiround PIR, where the queries in each round are allowed to depend on the answers received in previous rounds.

Efficient Integral Equation Algorithms and Their Application to RFID Installation,Efficient Integral Equation Algorithms and Their Application to RFID Installation by Joseph Daniel Brunett Co-Chairs: Valdis V. Liepa and Dipak L. Sengupta This research reduces the expense of solving multiscale frequency domain surface integral equation problems by application of an efficient hierarchical geometry description and an alternative approach to matrix conditioning. The cost of preparing a structure for simulation is minimized by multilevel retention of facet translation and rotation data. Overlapping sub-domain bases are then simultaneously applied via a new iterative procedure that ascertains the common sub-basis solution to the overdetermined system. This approach is highly convergent and provides accurate solutions without degradation to existing O(N) fast algorithms. New sheet impedance forms are introduced ensuring proper material representation. These methods are then applied in the optimization of low frequency Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensor placement on a metallic vehicle rim. Test methods required for accurate measurement of low frequency magnetic fields are discussed and measurements of an automobile wheel under like stimuli match simulated results.,frequency domain surface integral equation problems by application of an,"[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]"
Are the Determinants of Markup Size Industry-Specific?

Accordingly, the analysis of the dynamic panel is carried out on an industry-by-industry basis, allowing the coefficients on the markup determinants to vary across industries. We find that the oligopoly theory of markup determination for the most part holds for the manufacturing sector as a whole, although large variability in markup determinants exists across industries within the Slovenian manufacturing.

Distributed Recovery of Node Failures in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks,"Wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) additionally employ actor nodes within the wireless sensor network (WSN) which can process the sensed data and perform certain actions based on this collected data. In most applications, inter-actor coordination is required to provide the best response. This suggests that the employed actors should form and maintain a connected inter-actor network at all times. However, WSANs often operate unattended in harsh environments where actors can easily fail or get damaged. Such failures can partition the inter-actor network and thus eventually make the network useless. In order to handle such failures, we present a connected dominating set (CDS) based partition detection and recovery algorithm. The idea is to identify whether the failure of a node causes partitioning or not in advance. If a partitioning is to be occurred, the algorithm designates one of the neighboring nodes to initiate the connectivity restoration process. This process involves repositioning of a set of actors in order to fix the connectivity problem. The overall goal in this restoration process is to localize the scope of the recovery and minimize the movement overhead imposed on the involved actors. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through simulation",the connectivity restoration process is to localize the scope of the,"[0.09090909090909091, 0.09090909090909091, 0.09090909090909091]"
